## Project Overview  
The network design includes the following key features:  
- **VLANs:** Segmentation of the network to enhance performance and security.  
- **OSPF Protocol:** Dynamic routing for efficient path selection and redundancy.  
- **DHCP Configuration:** Automated IP address allocation for seamless device integration.  
- **Port Security:** Prevention of unauthorized access to switch ports.  
- **SSH Access:** Secure remote management of network devices.  
- **PAT (Port Address Translation):** Enable internet access for internal devices.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation and configuration.  
- **Networking Protocols**: OSPF, DHCP, SSH.  

## Objectives  
- Design a robust and scalable network infrastructure.  
- Implement advanced security measures to protect organizational data.  
- Ensure seamless communication across all departments and devices.
